The selection process (with more details on the 2025 summer assignments) will begin shortly.The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.Job DescriptionWhat's In it for YouOur purpose is to lead the way to tomorrow's energy network.

You will learn more about smart grid technology, renewable resources, forecasting and the latest developments in energy industry. You will see how the work you do this summer contributes directly to the success of the California Grid.Data validation and user acceptance testing (UAT), schedule and monitor processes necessary for calculation and publication of energy market settlement statements and invoices.Development of enterprise-wide systems integration mapping, with database that links to interface specification. Interface with IT Architects, UML Modelers, and QA Leads to understand how to best depict these system-to-system interfaces to meet specific use cases.Provide technical content and sample code for the ISO's developer.caiso.com website.Document archiving solutions for new technologies as well as development of automation solutions.Oracle Database/Storage task queue maintenance, documentation, create automation scripts for Oracle database admin tasks/storage procurement and document, create automated reports of daily DBA/Storage procedures, create standard monitoring scripts, generate capacity reports.Projects to develop work products that will reduce processing time, enhance transparency or enhance capabilities in departments across the organization.QualificationsLevel of Education and DisciplineCurrently in a Bachelor's degree (BS) or Masters degree (MS) program in Computer Science, MIS or related field.Graduating December of 2025 or later.Amount Of ExperiencePrevious internships, research or work experience using economic analysis is desired.Research and or studies in energy industry highly desired.Type Of ExperienceProficient in Microsoft office suite.Good presentation, oral and written communication skills highly desirable.
